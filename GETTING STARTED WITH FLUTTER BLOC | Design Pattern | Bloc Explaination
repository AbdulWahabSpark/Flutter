BLoC is an acronym for business logic components. The Flutter BLoC package makes it easy to implement the bloc pattern recommended by Google (Google I/O 2018).

BLoC was created with three guiding principles in mind:

Simple: It’s simple to grasp and can be used by developers of all skill levels.

Powerful: Assist in the creation of remarkable, sophisticated applications by breaking them down into smaller components.

Testable: We can easily test every part of an application so we can confidently iterate.

There are four main layers of application in the BLoC pattern:


UI. The UI contains all of the application’s components that the user can see and interact with.

BLoC. The bloc is the layer between the data and the UI components. The bloc receives events from an external source and emits a state in response to the received event.

Repository. The repository is designed to be the single source of truth, it is responsible for organizing data from the data source(s) to be presented by the UI.

Data providers. The data providers are responsible for fetching the application data, they are characterized by network calls and database interactions.

*********

Events: Events are input to a bloc, they’re usually added as a result of user activities like button pushes, or lifecycle events like page loads. You can model your event as anything, from a primitive data type, such as an integer, to any complex abstracted classes.

abstract class AuthEvent {}
class LoginEvent extends AuthEvent {}
class LogoutEvent extends AuthEvent {}
States: States are an output of a bloc, they represent the application state. The UI components listen to a state change and redraw a portion of themselves based on the current state. The state can also be modeled as anything from a primitive data type, such as an integer, to any complex abstracted classes.

abstract class AuthState {}
class UnAuthenticatedState extends AuthState {}
class AuthenticatedState extends AuthState {}
Bloc: A bloc uses an event to trigger a state change. Blocs are event receivers that turn incoming events into outgoing states.

class AuthBloc extends Bloc < AuthEvent, AuthState > {
  AuthBloc(): super(UnAuthenticatedState());
}
